# JAX-Transformer-Explainability

A JAX reimplementation of Hila Chefer **et al.**'s [Transformer Explainability](https://github.com/hila-chefer/Transformer-Explainability) work, for a class project. 

We learned quite a bit from this, many thanks to Chefer and colleagues for open sourcing their work! 

Our reproduction of their results can be found at https://github.com/miketynes/Transformer-Explainability

All of our tests and initial experiments on MNIST are found in the [nb](nb/) directory.
